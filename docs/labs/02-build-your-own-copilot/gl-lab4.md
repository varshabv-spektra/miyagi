# Lab 1: Bringing your own data with Azure AI Search

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will configure and run the Chat Copilot application locally using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search. After setting up the environment, you will upload your own documents and interact with them through a conversational interface. The application generates responses based on the uploaded content and provides citations to the source documents.

## Lab Scenario

Contoso wants to build an AI-powered assistant that enables employees to search and interact with internal documents using natural language. In this lab, you will configure Chat Copilot, connect it to Azure OpenAI, upload PDF documents, and use the application to retrieve accurate, citation-backed responses from your own data.

## Lab objectives 

In this lab, you'll run Chat Copilot locally after retrieving Azure OpenAI Service values from the Azure portal. By cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub repo and setting up dependencies, you'll configure and execute the application. Uploading documents enables interaction with Copilot, which generates responses based on their content, complete with citations for validation. This exercise provides hands-on experience in utilizing Chat Copilot with your own data, managing documents and sessions within the application.

### Task 2: Cloning the Chat-Copilot GitHub Repo

In this task, you will clone the Chat-Copilot GitHub repository by using Git commands to download the code to your local machine for further exploration and development.

1. On the **LabVM**, click **Start**, search for **PowerShell**, and open **PowerShell** as an administrator.

    ![](./Media/data5.png)  
   
1. Navigate to the directory `C:/Users/azureuser` by running the command below.
 
   ``` 
   cd C:/Users/azureuser
   ```

   ``` 
   git clone https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/chat-copilot CHAT-COPILOT
   ```
1. Open Visual Studio Code from the LabVM Desktop and click on `File (1) > Open Folder (2)`.

   ![](./Media/file-1.png)

1. Select **CHAT-COPILOT (1)** and click **Select Folder (2)**.

   ![](./Media/data7-1.png)

1. Review the files.

   ![](./Media/ch4.png)

   > **Note**: If the pop-up appears for **Do you trust the authors of the file in this folder?**, click on **Yes, I trust the authors.**   

### Task 3: Setting up the Environment

In this task, you will set up the environment for the Chat-Copilot project by installing necessary dependencies, configuring environment variables, and preparing the development environment for local execution.

1. Open **PowerShell** as an administrator on the **Lab VM**. Ensure that **PowerShell Core 6+** is installed, as it is different from the default PowerShell that comes with Windows.

   ![](./Media/data5.png)

1. Set up your environment by navigating to the scripts directory of chat-copilot using the command:

   ``` 
   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```

1. Run the following command to install Chocolatey, dotnet-7.0-sdk, nodejs, and yarn:

   ```
   .\Install.ps1
   ```

   >**Note:** If you receive an error that the script is not digitally signed or cannot execute on the system, you may need to change the execution policy or unblock the script.

### Task 4: Configure and run the Chat Copilot App locally

In this task, you will configure and run the Chat Copilot app locally by setting up the environment, adjusting configuration files, and launching the application for testing and development.

1. Run the following command to configure **Chat Copilot**.
   
   ```
   .\Configure.ps1 -AIService AzureOpenAI -APIKey <inject key="OpenAIKey" enableCopy="true"/> -Endpoint <inject key="OpenAIEndpoint" enableCopy="true"/> -CompletionModel <inject key="CompletionModel" enableCopy="true"/> -EmbeddingModel <inject key="EmbeddingModel" enableCopy="true"/>
   ```

   >**Note:** If a Security warning pop-up window appears, choose **Yes**
   >
   >**Note:** The code should look similar to the image below:

     ![](./Media/data8.png)

1. Run **Chat Copilot** locally. This step starts the **backend API** and **frontend** applications.
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Backend.ps1
   ```
   > **Note:** It may take a few minutes for Yarn packages to install on the first run.
 
1. Open another tab in **Edge**, in the browser window, paste the following link, and you should see a confirmation message:  `Healthy`.
 
   ```powershell
   http://localhost:40443/healthz
   ```
   > **Note:** Don't close the PowerShell window, keep it running.
  
     ![](./Media/data9.png)
    
1. In the LabVM, click on **Start**, from the start menu search and select **PowerShell 7**.

   ![](./Media/data10.png)
 
1. Run the following command to change the path.
 
   ```
   cd C:\Users\azureuser\chat-copilot\scripts\
   ```
 
1. Run the following command to set the execution policy.
 
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
 
1. The execution policy helps protect you from running untrusted scripts. Changing the execution policy may expose you to security risks described in the **about_Execution_Policies** help topic. If prompted with **“Do you want to change the execution policy?”**, enter **A** and press **Enter**.
 
1. Configure **Chat Copilot** by running the following command.
 
   ```powershell
   .\Start-Frontend.ps1
   ```

1. Once the script executes successfully, it will redirect to `http://localhost:3000/` Chat Copilot in **Edge** browser.
 
   >**Note:** Please wait for 2-3 minutes for the browser to load
  
1. You will get an output similar to this for the frontend:

   ![azure](./Media/data11.png)

1. You will get an output similar to this for the backend:

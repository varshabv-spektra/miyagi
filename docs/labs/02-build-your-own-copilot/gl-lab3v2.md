# Lab 3: Expose OpenAI through API Management Service

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll be verifying and creating APIs in the deployed **API Management Service** to update the Docker image for the Recommendation service. The revision of the Recommendation Service from the Container App reflects a meticulous approach to maintaining and optimizing containerized applications within the project's scope.

## Lab objectives 
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Verify the API Management Service and create an API with Operations
- Task 2: Update the Recommendation Service configuration to access Azure OpenAI through APIM
- Task 3: Verify that the Recommendation Service accesses Azure OpenAI through APIM

## Task 1: Verify the API Management Service and create an API with Operations

In this task, you will verify the API Management Service and create an API with operations by defining endpoints, setting policies, and testing the functionality to ensure proper integration and management of your APIs.

1. Navigate to the **Azure portal**, open the resource group named **miyagi-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, and select the **miyagi-apim-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** API Management service from the resources list.

   ![](./Media/opertation-completions.png)

1. Once the **completions** operation is created successfully, click on **+  Add operation** **(1)** fill in the following details in **Frontend** and click on **Save** **(6)**.

   | **Parameter**           | **Values**                                            | 
   | ------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------| 
   | Display name **(2)**    | **embeddings**                                       | 
   | Display name **(3)**    | **embeddings**                                          |

   | URL **(5)**             | in text box enter **/openai/deployments/<inject key="EmbeddingModel" enableCopy="false"/>/embeddings**  |

   ![](./Media/opertation-embeddings.png)

1. Once the **embeddings** operation is created successfully, click on the **Overview (1)** page, and copy the **Gateway URL (2)** Paste the Gateway URL into a notepad; you need this in the  upcoming task.

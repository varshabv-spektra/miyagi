# Lab 1 - Run Miyagi App Locally

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Scenario

You are a developer on the Contoso team responsible for the Miyagi application. The Recommendation service is not yet configured for local development, preventing the team from testing personalized recommendations. Your task is to configure the application, run the services locally, integrate Azure AI Search, and verify that the recommendation service works successfully.

## Overview

In this lab, the focus is on configuring the Miyagi App for operational readiness. Subsequently, attention shifts to understanding the nuanced implementation of the Recommendation service. The practical phase involves executing the Recommendation service and deploying the Miyagi frontend locally for testing and development. A crucial step is optimizing data retrieval efficiency by persisting embeddings in Azure AI Search. The project culminates with a broader exploration of the Miyagi App and Recommendation service, emphasizing a personalized user experience. This task-based approach ensures a systematic progression through the project intricacies, facilitating a comprehensive understanding and effective implementation.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Set up configuration for Miyagi app

## Task 2: Understanding the implementation of the Recommendation service

In this lab, you will explore the implementation of the Recommendation service, focusing on its algorithms and data processing methods to deliver personalized suggestions.

The Recommendation service implements the RAG pattern using the Semantic Kernel SDK. The details of the implementation are captured in the Jupyter notebook in the folder miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet. You can open the notebook in VSCode and run the cells to understand step-by-step details of how the Recommendation Service is implemented. Pay special attention to how the RAG pattern is implemented using Semantic Kernel. Select the kernel as **.NET Interactive** in the top right corner of the notebook.

1. In the Visual Studio Code, navigate to **miyagi/sandbox/usecases/rag/dotnet** folder and select **rag-workflow.ipynb**.

   ![](./Media/z0.png)

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the terminal by pressing **CTRL+J**, and run the following command to verify the installation of **.NET version 10.x.x**.

   ```
   dotnet --version
   ```

1. Open the Extensions panel using **Ctrl+Shift+X (1)**, search under the **recommended section (2)** and manually install the following two extensions:
 
   - **Python (3)** (by Microsoft)
   - **Jupyter (4)** (by Microsoft)

      ![](Media/ext01.png)

1. Once installed, run the following commands in the terminal to set up the .NET Interactive kernel for Jupyter.
 
   Install **.NET Interactive globally**:
 
   ```powershell
   dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.dotnet-interactive
   ```
   
   **Refresh the PATH** to make the tool available in the current terminal session:
   
   ```powershell
   $env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet\tools"
   ```
   
   **Install Jupyter** if it is not already present in the environment:
   
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install jupyter
   ```
   
   Register the .NET Interactive kernels with Jupyter:
   
   ```powershell
   dotnet-interactive jupyter install
   ```
   
   **Verify the kernels** were registered successfully:
   
   ```powershell
   jupyter kernelspec list
   ```
 
   You should see `.net-csharp`, `.net-fsharp`, and `.net-powershell` listed in the output.
 
   > **Close and reopen** Visual Studio Code to see the reflected changes.
 
1. Authenticate with your Azure account by running the following command in the terminal:
 
   ```powershell
   az login
   ```
 
   - A browser window will open prompting you to sign in. Select **Work or School Account** and provide your lab credentials.

   ```none
   az account show
   ```
   
   You should see your subscription details printed in the terminal.
 
1. Open the notebook file and select the appropriate kernel by clicking the **kernel selector** in the top-right corner of the notebook. Choose **Existing Jupyter Kernels -> .NET (C#)** for the notebook's language.

   ![](./Media/app-06.png)

   ![](./Media/app-07.png)
 
   > **Note:** If the newly installed kernels do not appear in the kernel selector immediately, wait 15–20 seconds and try again.
 
1. **Execute the notebook cell by cell** (using either Ctrl + Enter to stay on the same cell or Shift + Enter to advance to the next cell) and observe the results of each cell execution.
  
   > **Note**: Please do not click on the **Run All** option to execute all the cells at a time; this may lead to exceeding the token limit, resulting in the error: 503 Service unreachable.

   > **Note**: Ensure that the **Python extension** is installed before running the cells.
